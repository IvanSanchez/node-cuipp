node-cuipp
===============


What?
------------

**node-cuipp** is a *node.js* interface to *Cisco Unified IP Phone* services. If you have a fancy Cisco IP phone, this will help to show things on the screen and make the phone visit some URLs.


Why?
----------

Because I'm sick and tired of Cisco's examples, usually involving manually-typed XML, snippets of C code, and complete lack of library use.

I based myself on the "Cisco Unified IP Phone Services Application Development Notes (Supporting XML Applications) Release 8.5(1)" document. I don't know if this is out of date, though.



How? (do I use it)
---------------------

Check *example.js* for a basic set of sample commands.
